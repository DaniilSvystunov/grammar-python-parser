ToDo:
1. Fill the `constants.py` by other useful sites
2. Create relevant parser classes for them
3. Use asyncio/iohttp for parsers optimization
4. Find the way of how to store the large data (db or bson?)
5. Make it possible to iterate over all available parsers to run them in parallel and to be possible to run the single parser.
